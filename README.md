Artificial Intelligence Political Affiliation Test (AIPAT)

*** This project is currently in alpha stage and part of an ongoing R&D project. ***

Welcome to the AIPAT project! Our goal is to provide a transparent assessment of the political biases present in artificial intelligence LLM models. We believe that it is important for AI systems to be unbiased and fair, and when they are not, they should at least say so!

We want to emphasize that our intention is not to start political debates or discussions, but rather to promote transparency and objectivity in AI development. We understand that politics can be a sensitive topic, but we believe that it is essential to uncover any potential biases in order to ensure that AI systems are serving all people equally.
It can also help people decide which models are closer to their personal beliefs and own afiliation. 
(Spoiler-alert: There are clear differences)

Thank you for your interest in the AIPAT project! We appreciate your support and look forward to working together to create a more transparent future for AI.
